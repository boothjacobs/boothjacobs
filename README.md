Constantly shape-shifting. Previous lives include:
- [x] academic 
- [x] baker 
- [x] dude ranch staff
- [x] barista
- [x] cocktail waitress

I learn best by taking things apart and I'm a ruthlessly patient bug-hunter. Interested in niche UI problems and software that cares more about people than venture capital.

Fluent in JavaScript, React / Redux, HTML, and console errors, conversational in Python and CSS. Frontend/backend ambidextrous.

Ask me why I think coding and baking draw on the same skill set ðŸ˜ˆ
